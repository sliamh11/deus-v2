/**
 * `deus-native` AgentRuntime adapter (LIA-401 / B1).
 *
 * Unlike `claude`/`openai`/`llama-cpp` (thin `ContainerRuntime` wrappers that
 * spawn an isolated container and talk over IPC — see `container-backend.ts`),
 * `deus-native` is a standalone `AgentRuntime` implementation: it runs
 * LangChain's `createAgent` IN-PROCESS on the host. This is the first
 * production-registered, host-side, zero-container-sandboxed LLM execution
 * path in this repo — see docs/decisions/deus-v2-langchain-runtime.md for the
 * architectural decision and its threat-model reasoning.
 *
 * Non-goals of this adapter, intentionally deferred to later roadmap items
 * (do not add these here):
 * - Persona context and broader context-registry surfaces such as
 *   `MEMORY_TREE.md` and solution atoms. D4/LIA-418 closes the three accepted
 *   repository instruction-file gaps through lifecycle-events.ts; the
 *   unrelated persona and memory surfaces remain on their existing paths or
 *   deferred roadmap items.
 * - Real backend-scoped session persistence via the LangGraph checkpointer
 *   lands here (B4/LIA-404): the MESSAGE exchange itself genuinely persists
 *   and resumes across turns. Still deferred: session-open repository
 *   instruction content injected via `wrapModelCall`'s `systemMessage`
 *   remains a per-call,
 *   EPHEMERAL override — it is never written into the checkpointed
 *   `messages` state (confirmed: `AgentNode`'s `baseHandler` passes it
 *   directly to the model call and only ever writes the model's OWN response
 *   back into graph state) — so B3's documented once-per-session-lifecycle
 *   injection limitation is NOT fixed by this plan, contrary to an earlier
 *   draft's incorrect claim; re-supplying system context on every resumed
 *   turn (or persisting it into message state some other way) is real,
 *   separate future work, deliberately out of this ticket's scope. Also
 *   still deferred: `startOrResume` real-lookup parity for
 *   `multi-agent/orchestrator.ts`'s one-shot task path (correctly out of
 *   scope — that caller mints a fresh one-shot task per call by design) and
 *   any cleanup/expiry of accumulated checkpoint rows (unbounded growth, a
 *   separate future concern).
 * - Context windowing/summarization for the checkpointed message history
 *   (flagged by ai-eng-warden review). `agent.invoke()` loads the FULL
 *   accumulated `messages` channel on every resumed turn and sends it to the
 *   model as-is — per-turn token cost grows linearly, unbounded, for the
 *   life of a session. No cap, truncation, or summarization exists yet.
 *   Deliberately out of this ticket's scope; a real future concern once
 *   long-lived sessions are common.
 * - Any tool beyond web_search/web_fetch. B7/LIA-407 landed the wrapToolCall
 *   permission-rules engine (permission-rules.ts + middleware-stack.ts's
 *   real permissions layer, profile-selected via
 *   backendConfig.permissionProfile below), but it is an AUTHORIZATION layer
 *   only — SAFE_TOOL_NAMES is unchanged and widening the live tool surface
 *   still requires its own isolation review plus the replay-safety contract
 *   (docs/decisions/deus-v2-replay-safety.md).
 * - Middleware layer SUBSTANCE beyond permissions, memory, and wardens. The
 *   ordered/configurable middleware stack itself landed with B2/LIA-402, B7
 *   made the permissions layer real, D1/LIA-415 made the memory layer real
 *   for CONTROL-GROUP turns (one beforeModel retrieval per turn through the
 *   unchanged scripts/memory_retrieval_hook.py — non-control groups keep
 *   the pass-through observer on group-scoping safety grounds, tracked as
 *   AAG-014), and C1/LIA-409 made the wardens layer real (the unchanged
 *   `scripts/codex_warden_hooks.py` plan-review/code-review/ai-eng/
 *   verification gates now run over the deus-native `wrapToolCall` path).
 *   Telemetry remains the sole explicit observe-only placeholder (-> real
 *   usage accounting).
 * - Replay-safety auditing (B5/LIA-405), token/usage accounting events
 *   (B6/LIA-406).
 * - Nested subagent dispatch (B8/LIA-408) is now real: `runTurn()` builds a
 *   `dispatch_nested_agent` tool (`nested-dispatch-tool.ts`) so the parent
 *   agent can delegate a self-contained, contract-validated subtask to a
 *   one-shot, in-process child `createAgent` with its own independently
 *   selected model. This is NOT `src/multi-agent/orchestrator.ts`'s
 *   container-based `SubagentTask[]` scheduler — that primitive is
 *   unchanged; see docs/decisions/deus-v2-subagent-dispatch.md for how the
 *   two coexist.
 * - Consuming the middleware stack's inspectable `logs` output (added per
 *   ai-eng-warden review). `buildMiddlewareStack(...).logs` is discarded
 *   here (only `middleware` is destructured) -- each layer's log becomes a
 *   real observability/debug sink alongside whichever future item lands
 *   that layer's substance (B7 for permissions, telemetry's own usage-
 *   accounting work for that layer, etc.), not as part of B2 itself.
