/**
 * Runtime lifecycle events for the `deus-native` runtime (LIA-403 / B3).
 *
 * Parallel in spirit to `middleware-stack.ts` (B2) but scoped to
 * `runTurn`-level LIFECYCLE (session-open / per-prompt / turn-complete), not
 * tool/model-call middleware substance. Two concerns live here:
 *
 * 1. **Session-open context loading** (`loadSessionOpenContext`): composes
 *    vault context (LIA-416/D2 — control group only, via
 *    `vault-context.ts`'s `loadVaultContext` facade) with the group's own
 *    `groups/<folder>/CLAUDE.md` (and `groups/global/CLAUDE.md` for
 *    non-control groups, mirroring the container path's own main-vs-other
 *    distinction — `container-mounter.ts` mounts `/workspace/global`
 *    read-only only for non-main groups, and the container-side reader is
 *    `context-registry.ts`'s `GLOBAL RULES: CLAUDE.md` entry with
 *    `skipForControlGroup: true`). Called ONLY when the caller (`runTurn`)
 *    has already determined this is a genuinely NEW session — since
 *    B4/LIA-404 that signal is REAL checkpointer-tuple existence
 *    (`priorTuple === undefined` for the outgoing thread_id), NOT the
 *    pre-B4 `sessionRef.session_id === ''` string check — literal
 *    once-per-session gating: it runs once when a new runtime session opens
 *    and never repeats for the same open lifecycle. A resumed turn (an
 *    existing checkpointer tuple) never calls this at all.
 *
 * 2. **Prompt lifecycle hook** (`buildPromptLifecycleHook`): ONE middleware,
 *    TWO hooks with split responsibilities:
 *    - `beforeModel` is PURELY observational — it pushes a
 *      `PromptEventRecord` on every firing, matching B2's established
 *      inspectable-log pattern, and NEVER touches `messages` or
 *      any field with ordering semantics. Returning `{messages: [systemMsg]}`
 *      from `beforeModel` would merge through LangGraph's default `messages`
 *      reducer, which APPENDS — the system message would land AFTER the
 *      user's message, and `@langchain/anthropic`'s real payload converter
 *      (`message_inputs.js`: "System messages are only permitted as the
 *      first passed message") would then THROW at runtime, invisible to
 *      `FakeToolCallingModel` tests.
 *    - `wrapModelCall` does the actual session-open injection via
 *      `request.systemMessage` — the type-designed mechanism (`ModelRequest`
 *      explicitly carries `systemPrompt?`/`systemMessage?` for exactly
 *      this), which `AgentNode` keeps in a field separate from `messages`,
 *      guaranteeing position-0 placement in the provider payload. The
 *      injection applies UNIFORMLY on every `wrapModelCall` firing within a
 *      turn where `sessionOpenMessage` is defined — deliberately NO
 *      first-firing-only gating: `AgentNode` resets the system message to
 *      the agent's base/empty value at the START of every internal
 *      model-decision cycle, so a first-firing-only injection would silently
 *      drop the content on any follow-up/final model call after a tool use
 *      within the SAME turn.
 *
 * No in-process session tracking of any kind lives in this module — the
 * new-vs-resumed decision is made ONCE per call by `runTurn` reading its own
 * (now correctly populated) `sessionRef` parameter, and that one decision
 * governs whether `loadSessionOpenContext` is even called.
 *
 * Turn-complete processing is NOT here: `deus-native-backend.ts`'s `runTurn`
 * already emits the `turn_complete` `RuntimeEvent` unconditionally on
 * success (shipped B1 behavior) — B3 adds a regression test for it, not new
 * production code.

 * session-open injection is gated on CONTENT PRESENCE as well as

 *
 * Composition order (LIA-416/D2) is general-before-specific: vault context
 * first (personal identity/health/recent-memory — control group only, see
 * vault-context.ts's eligibility rationale), then global CLAUDE.md
 * (non-control groups only, unchanged), then group CLAUDE.md (most
 * specific, unchanged). The vault content already carries the reference
 * hook's own `=== ... ===` headers, so no wrapper header is added.
 *
 * Async solely because the vault pipeline's recent-sessions provider spawns
 * `memory_indexer.py` asynchronously — the await occurs only on a genuine
 * session open, and the existing global/group reads stay sync.
 *
 * Beyond vault context, scope is deliberately group-scoped CLAUDE.md ONLY:
 * `groups/<folder>/` is the real, group-scoped source the container path
 * bind-mounts as `/workspace/group`, so reading it for THAT group's own
 * session cannot leak into another group's session. `groups/global/CLAUDE.md`
 * is deliberately shared across all non-main groups by the EXISTING container
 * path's own design — an existing pattern mirrored, not a new risk.
 * AGENTS.md/AI_AGENT_GUIDELINES.md/persona context and full
 * `context-registry.ts` parity stay explicitly out of scope (see
 * deus-native-backend.ts's non-goals).
