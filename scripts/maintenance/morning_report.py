"""
Morning memory report (LIA-254) — daily "while you slept" digest.

At 07:00 (launchd/systemd/schtasks), summarize what changed overnight and
deliver it to the CONTROL GROUP chat: memory growth since yesterday + the
04:30 maintenance run's outcomes (any FAILED tasks or WARNs — a credential
expiry, a judge-calibration regression, etc. surface here instead of sitting
silently in a log nobody reads).

Why host-side (not a scheduler agent task): both data sources are unreachable
from a container — `logs/` is shadow-mounted empty for the control-group agent
(container-mounter.ts, LIA-210) and ~/.deus/ is outside the project root. So
this runs host-side (full fs access) and delivers via the same IPC file-drop
mechanism auth-refresh.ts uses: write a schema-valid message file into the
control group's IPC dir and the in-process watcher sends it to the chat.

Read-only on its sources. Reading ~/.deus/memory_health.jsonl is NOT re-running
`--health` — it's the persisted artifact the 04:30 run already wrote.

Exit 0 on a successful delivery OR a benign skip (no control group registered
yet, no data to report) — a benign skip is not a launchd failure. Exit nonzero
only on an unexpected error so the scheduler's error log surfaces real breakage.
